<p>Application for <strong>AWS Build on Vietnam</strong> 2022 event:
Solution for ZaloPay’s Challenge</p>

<p>Author: MasterYuri</p>
<h2 id="1-problems">1) Problems</h2>
<p>The challenge: As adoption of cashless transactions in Vietnam continues to grow, please propose a solution &amp; develop a feature for a mobile wallet that enables its users to pay for parking more conveniently.</p>

<p>When we recieved the challenge, we recognized that main key the judges wanted to give the contestants is “<strong>MORE CONVENIENTLY</strong>”. So that, we decided to choose “<strong>NFC technology</strong>”, which is the best way(I think) to make a more conveniently transaction in retail sectors and some companies as Samsung or Apple are developing that technology.</p>

<p>Bunch of information was found give me some questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First is “Why this tech is not popular in specific: Vietnam”.</li>
  <li>Second is “Why don’t we inheritage it cuz Samsung have Samsung Pay, Apple have Apple Pay which are strongly being developed in non-cash payment”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we believed that this tech must not be wasted!</p>
<h2 id="2-solution">2) Solution</h2>
<p>We split this challenge into 3 parts: Basic architecture, backend, frontend.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Basic architecture</strong>: We decided to build a plan, which services would be used and the effect. we had create DFD first to develop AWS architecture to visualize not only backend but also frontend.<img src="./DataFlowLv1.png" /><img src="./CheckIn.png" /><img src="./CheckOut.png" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BNDGoKg.png" alt="" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MoUUQZK.png" alt="" />

  </li>
  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: After we had Basic architecture, we can easily find the way out to figure the construction of the backend which AWS services in simple way: AWS lambda, S3 bucket, DynamoDB, Amazon Rekognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: We had build the app which can read NFC signal.<img src="./Transaction.png" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPVfW4G.jpg" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-result">3) Result</h2>
<p>With our solution, we were luckily chosen to be qualified to the finale of AWS Build on Vietnam and the solution was chosen to be the Best Technicality.</p>
